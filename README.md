A simple, open-source AI app that uses Grok.

### Features:
- multiple chats
- tool calling (currently just time, but will expand)
- streaming long responses
- multimodal input (photo upload)
- markdown formatted text output

### Why use Grok?
It's the cheapest, and I like it. I'm not trying to support any other LLMs with this app.
